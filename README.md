# Canted - A stylish portfolio concept

Inspired by [We Ain't Plastic](http://weaintplastic.com/), I built a modern, miminalist portfolio website that loads projects via AJAX into modal windows. The HTML, CSS, and jQuery has been coded by me, except for normalize stylesheet and the smooth scroll script. To check out the live website, click [here](http://amanbis.github.io/canted/).
