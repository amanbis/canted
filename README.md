# Canted - A stylish portfolio concept

Inspired by [We Ain't Plastic](http://weaintplastic.com/), I built a modern, miminalist portfolio website that loads projects via AJAX into modal windows. Most of the HTML, CSS, and jQuery has been hand-coded by me, except for normalize stylesheet and the smooth scroll script.
